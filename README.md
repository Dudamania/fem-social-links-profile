## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - Mobile First Toolkit
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Library

### What I learned

Progressed on my knowledge of using rem as font sizes instead of px as to provide a better responsiveness in fonts across mobile and destop layouts.

```css
p {
  font-size: 0.875rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue my learning of better responsive css practices, as well as using variables more to make future design changes easier.
